MMPlugin, Base:
  Assumptions:
    - Load must be the first function called on ISmmPlugin.
      - Must be called before Pause, Unpause, AllPluginsLoaded, Unload
    - OnVSPListening must never be called after Unload

  Limitations:
    - Plugins may not always receive Unload, Pause, Unpause if they depend on OnVSPListening
      - Because it is assumed that these can precede OnVSPListening
      - Plugins will always receive AllPluginsLoaded, even if it occurs before OnVSPLsitening

  ToDo:
    - Handle ISmmPlugin events' bool return status
    - Load done in OnVSPListening cannot pass err or errLen, so currently we just pass nullptr and 0. Also must ignore return value
